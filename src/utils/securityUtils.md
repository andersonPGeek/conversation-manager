# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the application to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. XSS Protection

- Input sanitization using DOMPurify library
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation via meta tags

### 2. Clickjacking Protection

- X-Frame-Options header set to DENY via meta tags

### 3. Rate Limiting for Login

- IP-based rate limiting for login attempts
- Temporary account lockout after multiple failed attempts

## Server-Side Recommendations

For a production environment, the following server-side headers should be implemented:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://api.dicebear.com https://images.unsplash.com data:;
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **HTTPS Implementation**: Ensure all communication is encrypted using HTTPS.

2. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.

3. **Secure Cookie Attributes**: Set Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes for cookies.

4. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

5. **Input Validation**: Implement server-side input validation in addition to client-side sanitization.

6. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

7. **Authentication Best Practices**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Implement account lockout policies

8. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Implement alerting for potential security incidents
